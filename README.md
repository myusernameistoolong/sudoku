# Sudoku AI in C#

This is a C# console application that allows users to play and solve Sudoku puzzles. The main focus of the project is a custom-built AI that can solve Sudoku puzzles efficiently using **recursion** and **backtracking** algorithms.

## Features

- âœ… Console interface for inputting and solving Sudoku puzzles  
- ðŸ§  AI-based solver for classic Sudoku  
- ðŸŒˆ Killer Sudoku variation with colored regions for added complexity  
- âš¡ Demonstrates how the AI solves puzzles significantly faster than a human

## How it Works

The AI uses a recursive backtracking algorithm to explore possible solutions. It checks for constraints row-wise, column-wise, and within each 3x3 box (or color regions in the case of Killer Sudoku). The console interface visualizes the process and highlights the speed and accuracy of the AI.
